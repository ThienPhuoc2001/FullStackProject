At this point all configuration / setup / installations / boilerplate are pretty much done.

Each feature from this point can be implemented like this:

Build the UI element (button / input field, etc)
Build the state container + events for the UI elements
Figure out what data you need to send/retrieve from backend and make RequestDto and optionally response DTO from this
Build the Controller method
Build the Service method
Write a unit test for it
Re-run the API to generate the new Typescript code to use in React
Use the Typescript method to call your API from React
Make state change/feedback depending on success/failure
